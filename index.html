    <h3 class="h3">Coding...But Why?</h3>
    <p>After being thrust into the world post-college, Brandon landed a job in sales and quickly discovered the working world was not all rainbows and butterflies.</p>
    <p>After two years working in a stressful environment, he decided it was time to make a change. Brandon identified a few different paths he could transverse, and after careful consideration, set his sights on learning how to code.</p>
    <p class="black">Coding makes up the building blocks of our modern day world. Harnessing his inner creativity, Brandon saw this not only as an evolving field, but an opportunity to cultivate a better tomorrow.</p>
